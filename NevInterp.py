# NevInterp.py
#
# by Sean E. Lake
# Originally written at UCLA some time between 2010 and 2017 as part of my
# thesis project.
#
# This small library contains implementations of Neville's algorithm that are 
# different from the usual ones in textbooks. First, no assumption is made about
# the spacing of the x-values, so execution speed will be suffer in those special
# cases, but the applicability of the functions is broader. Second, when the 
# function being interpolated is known to be even, you can apply this library's
# 'Even' functions to get improved numerical performance.
#
# The primary application this library was designed for is performing Romberg
# integration with optimal numerical accuracy and as few decimations of the 
# interval as possible. It is the intrinsic evenness of numerical integration
# schemes, when properly implemented, that inspired the Even functions. 
# Of primary use is the 'Round' functions, for their robust performance in the
# face of divergence of the algorithm.
