# SELPythonLibs

This Github contains some utility libraries that I have found personally
useful. The quality of the code varies by how much I've used it, from
quite good in the cases I've applied it to, to, "I think it should work." So,
no guarantees are made of the fitness of this code for any purpose. If you
notify me of a bug, I'll try to fix it if I have time (depending on the
complexity of the bug/fix).

At any rate, I hope you find this code useful, too.
